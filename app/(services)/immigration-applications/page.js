                                <h3>Student Visa</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A lot of study permit applications from outside of Canada get refused every year. A successful application needs strong attention on assessment of candidate's profile, selection of appropriate course, demonstrating intentions via a strong Statement of Purpose (SOP), and a convincing Submission Letter. At Rathod Law Firm, Mr. Kapil Rathod specifically pays attention to the profile of the Student and helps the Student select a course according to his/her profile. Mr. Kapil Rathod himself writes a strong submission letter.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Work Permit</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Whether it is a Spousal Open Work Permit or LMIA-based work permit, Mr. Rathod pays complete attention to details. For Spousal Work Permit Applications, specific attention needs to be paid to proving relationship. Mr. Rathod has done more than 2,500 Spousal Open Work Permit applications in his 13 years of practice. LMIA-based work permit applications are also detailed and certain key things need to be observed while doing such applications. Mr. Rathod pays attention to details in such applications as well.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>LMIA Applications</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Rathod Law Firm does not have any connections with the employers and cannot find employment for prospective applicants; however, the firm processes applications for Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) on behalf of the employers.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Visitor Visa</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Every year, a lot of people visit Canada; however, in such applications, specific attention must be paid to the 'return' of the applicants to their home country. Ties to home country must be established and a detailed submission letter as well as Invitation Letter must be written to convince the Visa Officer of the return of the Applicant. Mr. Rathod has vast experience in dealing with visitor visa applications as well as Super Visa Applications.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Refugee Claims</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Some people cannot return to their home countries after landing in Canada because of fear of persecution. They can make refugee protection claims in Canada; however, demonstrating this fear of persecution is a work of detail. On the basis of the evidence that the Applicants have, Mr. Rathod prepares a detailed submission in support of a Refugee Claim and also attends the hearing at the Refugee Protection Division followed by appeal at the Refugee Appeal Division followed by appeal at the Federal Court of Canada.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Permanent Residence Applications</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Express Entry has been constantly evolving and so as Provincial Nominee Class applications. In the constantly changing rules, Mr. Rathod ensures that the candidate 'actually' qualifies and advises the clients on best possible ways of becoming a permanent resident of Canada. Mr. Rathod genuinely advises the Applicants if they do not qualify.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Spousal Sponsorships</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Specific attention must be paid to detail in spousal sponsorship applications. Relationships can be complex at times. Putting the relationship on paper is a tough task and Mr. Rathod does it in a convincing manner so that Applicants do not have to attend an interview in most cases.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Refused Visa Applications</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Mr. Rathod specifically likes dealing with applications that have been refused previously. Mr. Rathod accurately identifies key issues with the applications, suggests further documents to the Applicants and resubmits the application with a convincing submission letter. If such applications are still refused, Mr. Rathod also advises the applicants to take their refused applications to the Federal Court of Canada for judicial review.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Procedural Fairness Letters</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In certain scenarios, Procedural Fairness Letters are issued to the applicants. For example, if applicants fail to declare their previous refusal of any country in their Canadian visa application, this becomes a reason for issuance of procedural fairness. If the IRCC Officer finds the relationship of two persons to be not genuine, this also becomes a reason for issuance of procedural fairness letter. Such letters must be carefully answered. Mr. Rathod analyzes the issues in the letter and prepares the best response on the basis of prevailing laws.
                                </p>
