                                <p>
                                    A lot of people are unaware of the fact that their refused visa application can be appealed to the Federal Court of Canada.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Judicial Review Applications</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When visa applications are refused, often people apply for the second time and if they face repeated refusals, they stop doing further applications and do not seek legal avenues available to them. Any kind of application as noted below can be appealed to the Federal Court of Canada through "Judicial Reviews":
                                </p>
                                
                                <ul className="service-details-content__list">
                                    <li>Visitor Visa Applications</li>
                                    <li>Work Permit Applications</li>
                                    <li>Study Permit Applications</li>
                                    <li>Permanent Residence Applications</li>
                                    <li>Refugee Applications</li>
                                    <li>Spousal Work Permit Applications</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>
                                    If you believe that you have provided sufficient information and you qualify for this application and still the visa officer has refused the application, you may apply to the Federal Court of Canada to have your application judicially reviewed.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    At Rathod Law Firm, we process such Judicial Review Applications. Typical processing time for such applications is approximately 6 to 10 months. Upon successful appeal at the Federal Court of Canada, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) reopens the refused application and have it assessed by a different and independent officer. Judicial Reviews are helpful typically in repeated refusals.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Mandamus Applications</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Certain immigration applications take longer than usual. If you think that your application has surpassed the suggested processing time on IRCC's website and you think that this delay is unreasonable, you may file a Writ of Mandamus at the Federal Court of Canada to have this application processed.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Upon successful Mandamus Application at the Federal Court of Canada, the Court directs the IRCC to process the application in a specific timeline.
                                </p>
