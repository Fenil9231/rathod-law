                                <h2>Refugee Appeals - How Does a Refugee Claim Work in Canada?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The process for claiming refugee status in Canada involves several steps. Here's an overview of how it typically works:
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>1. Arrival in Canada</h3>
                                <p>
                                    To make a refugee claim, you generally need to be physically present in Canada. If you're arriving at a port of entry (like an airport) or already inside the country, you can start the process there.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>2. Making the Claim</h3>

                                    <h4>At a Port of Entry:</h4>
                                    <p>If you're arriving from abroad, you can make your claim at a Canadian border crossing, airport, or seaport. You'll need to provide information about why you fear returning to your home country.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Inside Canada:</h4>
                                    <p>If you're already in Canada, you can make your claim at a local Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) office or at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) office.</p>

                                    <h4>Eligibility Assessment:</h4>
                                    <p>An immigration officer will assess whether you meet the criteria to make a refugee claim. This includes checking if you have a valid reason to fear persecution or if your claim is eligible under Canadian law.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Documentation:</h4>
                                    <p>You'll need to provide identification and details about your claim, including a detailed account of why you fear persecution or risk in your home country.</p>
                                </div>

                                <ul className="service-details-content__list">
                                    <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> If your claim is accepted for consideration, you'll be scheduled for a hearing before the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Preparing:</strong> You should prepare evidence and any documents that support your claim. It's highly recommended to seek legal advice or representation from a lawyer or a legal aid service.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> At the hearing, you'll present your case and explain why you fear returning to your home country. The IRB member will ask questions and review your evidence.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <h4>Positive Decision:</h4>
                                    <p>If the IRB grants you refugee status, you'll receive a positive decision, which means you are recognized as a refugee and can stay in Canada. You may then apply for permanent residence.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Negative Decision:</h4>
                                    <p>If your claim is denied, you may have options to appeal the decision or seek judicial review. If all appeals fail, you could be asked to leave Canada.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Permanent Residence:</strong> If granted refugee status, you can apply for permanent residency, which can eventually lead to citizenship.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rights and Responsibilities:</strong> As a recognized refugee, you have certain rights (such as access to healthcare and work) and responsibilities (such as abiding by Canadian laws).</li>
